# How it works
You need a domain with [catch-all-mailbox](https://www.google.ch/search?q=how+to+setup+catch-all+imap+mailbox) and an imap account. 

Your run the void-mail nodejs application on your own server. It will automatically load all mails from the imap server. 

When the user opens the void-mail web application, he/she can read the mails corresponding to a specific address.  

See [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

## TODO

This mostly works, but some things need to be done:

Testing:
-   create unit/integration tests

Maybe Later:
- support multiple domains
- support delete
- ~~docker deployment~~
- reduce code base, if possible
